# Summary:
According the result, compare the Vine menbers vs. Non-Vine menbers, 5 start rating data didn't show too much different between these two group menbers. Therefore, there is no clear bias for 5-star rating in Vine menbership. 
I would do more further analysis for different category review, the data may show more detail for the interest of Vine menbers. There are 613 Vine menbers in this data set,only 0.9 % is Vine menbers in this selected dataset. I would analyze more data set before make any conclusions about bias.
