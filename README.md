# Summary:
According to this result, 5 start rating data didn't show too much different between the Vine and Non-Vine menbers. Therefore, there is no clear conclusion for bias of 5-star rating in Vine menbers. 
I would do more further analysis for different category review, the data may show more detail for the interest of Vine menbers. There are 613 Vine menbers in this data set,only 0.9 % is Vine menbers in this selected dataset. I would analyze more data set before make any conclusions about bias.
